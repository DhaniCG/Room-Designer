This project is a challenge project after I finished css course on codecademy.com, you can think of it as a portfolio but abviously, no way I'm gonna get hired if I only do html and css right? or you can think of it as potential, I'm not saying I'm good, so far I only used the same kind of design, similar look to the other website that I have... but I quiet like it
